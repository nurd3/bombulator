# Hopes and Dreams
Features that are currently facing developer hell for whatever reason despite just how cool and neat they would be to have.

    * currently, the climate mod in Exile does not provide globally accessible functions for manipulating the weather,
    though it does provide chatcommands which possibly could be exploited though I wouldn't count on it.
